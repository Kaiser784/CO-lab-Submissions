General Lab instructions
- [ ] Write the Assembly Language Program (ALP) for the following questions.
- [ ] Compile and execute those programs and display the outputs.
- [ ] Attach the screen shots of your programs with compilation, execution and outputs details.
- [ ] Submit all the answers as a single PDF file named with your roll number.

## Lab 2
```
1. Choose two positive numbers 100 ≤ P1, P2 ≤ 999. Write ALP for addition of these two numbers (i.e. P1+P2) 
   and display the result as the output.

2. Write ALP for subtraction of these two numbers (i.e. P1 − P2) and display the result as the output.

3. Write ALP for multiplication of these two numbers (i.e. P1 ∗ P2) and display the result as the output.

4. Write ALP for division of these two numbers (i.e. P1/P2) and display the result as the output.

5. Write ALP for increment of the number P1 (i.e. P1 + 1) and display the result as the output.

6. Write ALP for decrement of the number P1 (i.e. P1 − 1) and display the result as the output.

7. Write ALP for AND operation of the numbers P1, P2 (i.e. P1 ∧ P2) and display the result as the output.

8. Write ALP for OR operation of the numbers P1, P2 (i.e. P1 ∨ P2) and display the result as the output.

9. Write ALP for XOR operation of the numbers P1, P2 (i.e. P1 L P2) and display the result as the output.

10. Write ALP for Left shift operation of the number P1 by 3 bits (i.e. P1  3 = P1 ∗ 8) 
    and display the result as the output.

11. Write ALP for Right shift operation of the number P1 by 2 bits (i.e. P1  2 = P1/4) 
    and display the result as the output.

## Lab 3
```
1. Choose five numbers between 100 and 999. 
   Write ALP by using conditional instructions for finding the largest of these five numbers
   and display the result as the output.
   
2. Choose a random number 20 ≤ R ≤ 100.
   Write ALP by using loops for printing the numbers (i.e. from 1 to R) 
   and display the result as the output.

3. Write ALP by using recursion for finding a factorial of number between 5 and 30 
   and display the result as the output.

4. Choose a positive value 5 ≤ P ≤ 20.
   Write ALP by defining a P-element array containing P random values 
   and do the sum of these values in the array 
   and display the result as the output.
