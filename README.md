- [ ] Compile and execute those programs and display the outputs.
- [ ] Attach the screen shots of your programs with compilation, execution and outputs details.
- [ ] Submit all the answers as a single PDF file named with your roll number.

## Lab 2
```
1. Choose two positive numbers 100 ≤ P1, P2 ≤ 999. Write ALP for addition of these two numbers (i.e. P1+P2) 
   and display the result as the output.

2. Write ALP for subtraction of these two numbers (i.e. P1 − P2) and display the result as the output.

3. Write ALP for multiplication of these two numbers (i.e. P1 ∗ P2) and display the result as the output.

4. Write ALP for division of these two numbers (i.e. P1/P2) and display the result as the output.

5. Write ALP for increment of the number P1 (i.e. P1 + 1) and display the result as the output.

6. Write ALP for decrement of the number P1 (i.e. P1 − 1) and display the result as the output.

7. Write ALP for AND operation of the numbers P1, P2 (i.e. P1 ∧ P2) and display the result as the output.

8. Write ALP for OR operation of the numbers P1, P2 (i.e. P1 ∨ P2) and display the result as the output.

9. Write ALP for XOR operation of the numbers P1, P2 (i.e. P1 L P2) and display the result as the output.

10. Write ALP for Left shift operation of the number P1 by 3 bits (i.e. P1  3 = P1 ∗ 8) 
    and display the result as the output.

11. Write ALP for Right shift operation of the number P1 by 2 bits (i.e. P1  2 = P1/4) 
    and display the result as the output.

## Lab 3
```
1. Choose five numbers between 100 and 999. 
   Write ALP by using conditional instructions for finding the largest of these five numbers
   and display the result as the output.
   
2. Choose a random number 20 ≤ R ≤ 100.
   Write ALP by using loops for printing the numbers (i.e. from 1 to R) 
   and display the result as the output.

3. Write ALP by using recursion for finding a factorial of number between 5 and 30 
   and display the result as the output.

4. Choose a positive value 5 ≤ P ≤ 20.
   Write ALP by defining a P-element array containing P random values 
   and do the sum of these values in the array 
   and display the result as the output.

## Lab4
```
1. Given a positive number, write ALP for verifying whether it is a prime number or not, and display the result as the output.

2. Given a positive number, write ALP for verifying whether it is an Armstrong number or not, and display the
   result as the output. (An Armstrong number is an n-digit number such that sum of its digits raised to the power n is the number itself.
   Armstrong numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 153, 370, 371, 407, 1634, 8202, 9474, 54748, etc.. 
      For eg: 153 because 13 + 53 + 33 = 153, 1634 because 14 + 64 + 34 + 44 = 1634, and 54748 because 55 + 45 + 75 + 45 + 85 =54748.)

3. Given a positive number, write ALP for verifying whether it is a palindrome number or not, and display the result as the output. 
      An palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. For eg: 16461

4. Given a string, write ALP for counting number of words, characters (including spaces), vowels, consonants,
   and display the result as the output. 
      For eg: given ‘Hello IIITDM Kancheepuram’, then program should display number of words = 3, characters = 25, vowels = 10, consonants = 13
